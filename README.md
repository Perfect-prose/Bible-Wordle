KJV Wordle is a web-based word-guessing game inspired by the popular game Wordle, but with a unique twist: all the words are five-letter words found in the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. It offers a simple, reverent, and engaging way to interact with biblical vocabulary.

The goal is to guess the hidden word in six attempts. After each guess, the game provides color-coded feedback, letting you know which letters are correct and in the right position.
